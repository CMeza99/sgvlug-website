# SGVLUG Website

Excerpted from following presentation by James McDuffie
http://sgvlug.github.io/website_presentation

- Generated by Pelican (http://docs.getpelican.com/), a Python-based static web generator
- Content can be written in Markdown, reStructuredText or AsciiDoc

Getting Started
===============
    
Install Pelican and ghp-import

```
$ pip install pelican
$ pip install ghp-import
```

Checkout source (read only)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sgvlug/website.git sgvlug_website
```

If you are added to access list you can clone this way:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sgvlug/website.git sgvlug_website
```

Creating a New Post
===================

Open an editor to create a new post:

```
$ vim content/posts/2014-02-13-lightning-talks.md
```

Convention is to name the file with event date, then event title.  The date in the post should be when it was written.

The contents of the post need at least the Title and Date meta data in the header. Contents of the post is regular Markdown below the header lines.

```
Title: Lightning Talks
Date: 2014-02-13 22:33

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. 
Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one
```

Testing Website
===============

Pelican includes a small development server so you can see what the site will look like when you deploy it. Run the following:

```
$ make devserver
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/

Deploying Website
=================

Once you are satisfied with the changes, use git to save your changes and upload to Github:

```
$ git add content/posts/<your_new_file>.md
$ git commit -m "What I did here was add a new post"
$ git push origin master
```

Deploying to github is made easy using ghp-import and Pelican's Makefile:

```
$ make github
```

Easy Way to Make Posts from Meetup Events
=========================================

James made a script to easily convert the contents of the SGVTech meetup events into Markdown for Pelican. It also adds some meta data about the event data and location.

Obtain meetup2md
================

Download meetup2md from Github and initialize it's submodules:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/omwah/meetup2md.git
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Authorize meetup2md
===================

We need to set up OAuth so the script can access Meetup. Create a new consumer key and secret here:
http://meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers

Set up authentication with the program:

```
$ meetup2md.py --consumer <key> <secret>
```
Hit allow on the web page that is loaded by the script. Now pass the verification code to the script:

```
$ meetup2md.py --verifier 183742
```

Configure meetup2md for LUG
===========================

Edit the [events] section of app.cfg to allow us to easily to filter out SGVLUG events:

```
[events]
group_name = SGVTech
name_filter = SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting
title_cleanup = ^SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting -
```

Creating an Article from a Meetup Event
=======================================

From the sgvtech_website directory you can create a post for the SGVLUG meetups scheduled within the next month:
    
```
$ meetup2md.py -t ,1m -o content/posts
```

* -t indicates a time range
* -o specifies where to output files


Creating an Article from a Meetup Event
=======================================

You will see something like this:

```
Name: SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting - Lightning Talks
Title: Lightning Talks
Time: Thursday February 13, 2014 07:00 PM
Venue: Burger Continental, 535 S Lake Ave, Pasadena, CA, 91101
 -> content/posts/2014-02-13-lightning-talks.md
----
```

Finishing Up
============

Load up the devserver to check the post, commit if everything looks fine.
