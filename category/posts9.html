<p>April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is back!  </p>
<p>Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and software<br />
project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book reader for developing   <br />
nations.                                                                       </p>
<p>The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of Wikipedia and<br />
display it on any TV set in a developing-world village library - all for under 
$20. It is also a fun general purpose 8-bit computing platform comparable in <br />
raw capability to the Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and   <br />
hobbyists. The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross   <br />
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.                             </p>
<p>The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab, assembly, <br />
and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience through each stage, cover  <br />
which tools were used, ponder major design considerations, and pay special   <br />
attention to open source solutions.                                            </p>

<p>Topic: Data Ownership - How I (mostly) wrestled control of my data from evil <br />
corporate overlords                                                            </p>
<p>Speaker: Charles N Wyble                                                       </p>
<p>Charles Wyble is a systems and security engineer. His focus in 2010 is       <br />
security research, with a particular emphasis on improving performance of    <br />
automated analytic systems. In support of this, he does a lot of networking  <br />
stuff and is in the process of building a malware lab.                         </p>
<p>He lives in sunny southern California, with his wife Patricia and 2 dogs ISIS<br />
and OSPF. Yes they are named after routing protocols. He frequently hosts    <br />
hacker parties, where all sorts of cool stuff gets built. You will often find<br />
him at various hot startups doing consulting, and at numerous user group     <br />
meetings throughout the southwestern United States.                            </p>
<p>Charles Wyble will be joining the SGVLUG group once again and discussing the <br />
topic of data ownership / private cloud.                                       </p>
<p>Owning ones data is a critical and often overlooked part of security. As such, 
he will discuss how he maintains numerous web properties on a Linux server at<br />
his residence, connected to the best DSL ATT has to offer.                     </p>
<p>He has recently completed moving all his data onto his own server, freeing it<br />
(mostly) from the control of google,yahoo etc. It was a relatively           <br />
straightforward process, encompassing 4 major phases. He will talk about the <br />
tools he utilizes, and advantages/disadvantages to his setup and some of the <br />
problems he encountered.                                                       </p>

<p>For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company developing<br />
new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets, like, for example, the  <br />
entire routing structure of the internet, or tens of thousands of documents.   </p>
<p>This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of Open   <br />
Source software which made the project possible. Dependencies included Boost,<br />
CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko, Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd,    <br />
Xerces DOM, and more. Theses building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and 
beyond) their limits, deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows         <br />
environment, and compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,<br />
better alternatives, and other findings.                                       </p>
