                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Orv Beach has been messing with computers for over 20 years. His first       <br />
experience with computer operating systems was with CP/M, in the early '80s. <br />
His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the  <br />
Linux community.                                                               </p>
<p>He's a principal member of the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, the Marketing  <br />
chair for the Linux Expo of Southern California, and is currently employed as<br />
the Information System Director at Simi Valley Hospital.                       </p>
<p>Orv will demonstrate various command line commands and utilities that are    <br />
useful for administering a Linux system. He'll throw in a few basic bash     <br />
tricks as a bonus.                                                             </p>

<p>What does an Internet pioneer and tycoon do when he still has too much money <br />
after paying the Russians to take him to the International Space Station? If <br />
you're Mark Shuttleworth, you start a Linux Company.                           </p>
<p>Jana Lingo will discuss the past, present, and future of one of the <em>hottest</em><br />
current Linux distributions. Topics will include Ubuntu<em>s goals, philosophy, <br />
history, and technology, as well as Jana</em>s personal experiences with Ubuntu  <br />
and its derivates.                                                             </p>

Simulation, and Really Remote Scheduling," Scott Maxwell and Frank Hartman,  <br />

<p>NASA/JPL's Mars Exploration Rover project is the first time a JPL flight     <br />
project has used Linux systems for critical mission operations. Scott Maxwell<br />
and Frank Hartman, two of MER's rover drivers, also wrote the Rover Sequencing 
and Visualization Program (RSVP), the Linux-based software used on Earth to  <br />
drive Spirit and Opportunity. Scott and Frank will discuss the software they <br />
developed, as well as their experiences using Linux to drive two vehicles    <br />
across the Martian terrain, a hundred million miles from Earth.                </p>
