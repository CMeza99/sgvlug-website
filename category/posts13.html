                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the 
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br />
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br />
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br />
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br />
InDaMixx.                                                                      </p>
<p>Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br />
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br />
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br />
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br />
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Chris got his kid an "OLPC" laptop and thinks he can wrestle it away from him<br />
long enough for some "show-n-tell"...                                          </p>
<p>OLPC is the "One Laptop Per Child" initiative, aimed at providing full-fledged 
laptop computers to every child in developing nations. Their goal is for a   <br />
$100/unit price point, and they are quite close (actually, the price is about<br />
$150)                                                                          </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Dan Kegel of Google, a longtime Linux user and developer, will present a     <br />
grab-bag of interesting topics:                                              <br />
<em> Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google's photo management    <br />
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don't know about the Linux 
  version)                                                                 <br />
</em> Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux's implementation of Win32; it   <br />
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 <br />
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux's answer to ZFS, kind of; it<br />
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   <br />
  those snapshots to remote systems.)                                        </p>
<p>Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager<br />
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  <br />
questions you like.                                                            </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Asterisk is an open-source PBX program that provides automatic call          <br />
distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      <br />
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br />
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br />
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br />
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                </p>
<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.                                                        </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX     <br />
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br />
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br />
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br />
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br />
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    </p>
<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br />
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br />
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br />
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br />
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br />
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br />
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br />
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br />
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br />
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br />
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br />
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br />
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.  </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    <br />
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         <br />
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  </p>
<p>Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions  <br />
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       <br />
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his<br />
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      <br />
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and <br />
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior  <br />
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at 
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both 
http://www.voipspeak.net and http://www.asterisktutorials.com. Kerry is an   <br />
avid amateur photographer who writes tutorials and product reviews for his   <br />
photography blog site at http://L7Foto.com.                                    </p>
