                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most<br />
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br />
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br />
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer <br />
act like you were two people doing different things?                           </p>
<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  <br />
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause<br />
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on <br />
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br />
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 </p>
<p>If this describes you and you haven't heard of VMware, then you need to attend 
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we'll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems 
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer -- he plans<br />
to talk about the entier line -- from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br />
their newest offering, the "free" VMware player. (this is "free as in beer", <br />
folks...)                                                                      </p>

<p>Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM.

will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.                     </p>
<p>Mr. Finley has extensive software development and consulting experience on the 
HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and<br />
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  <br />
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He <br />
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     <br />
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        <br />
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the <br />
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics 
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.                              </p>

<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br />
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br />
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br />
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br />
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  </p>
<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br />
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br />
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br />
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the      <br />
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He's a partner in motion picture technology      <br />

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Matt Ingenthron from Sun Microsystems will review Sun's involvement in the   <br />
various open source communities and talk a bit about the latest, greatest hunk 
of intellectual property Sun's released to the wild: OpenSolaris.              </p>
<p>Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you      <br />
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also   <br />
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at  <br />
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/ before attending to develop your own    <br />
questions about the project.                                                   </p>
<p>Matt is a Technical Specialist for Sun Microsystems and supports a variety of<br />
customers across the Western US. Based in Los Angeles, Matt has worked with a<br />
number of customers on Linux and Solaris adoption and migration from other   <br />
platforms. Matt is part of the Web Services practice of the Client Solutions <br />
organization which specializes in use of Java Enterprise System software use <br />
