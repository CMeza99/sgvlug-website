<p>Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates (Y!PP) is a java-based persistant world RPG that has  <br />
been quietly gaining accolades for the past three years. Come join us for our<br />
October meeting where intern/developer Elizabeth Fong will tell tall (and not<br />
so tall) tales about life in the game industry and how it relates to Linux.    </p>
<p>About the presenter: Elizabeth has been programming for nearly 10 years and  <br />
started with linux four years ago when she began hosting sites from her home <br />
server. Starting this semester, she will be a freshman here at Caltech.        </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Matt Ingenthron from Sun Microsystems will review Sun's involvement in the   <br />
various open source communities and talk a bit about the latest, greatest hunk 
of intellectual property Sun's released to the wild: OpenSolaris.              </p>
<p>Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you      <br />
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also   <br />
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at  <br />
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/ before attending to develop your own    <br />
questions about the project.                                                   </p>
<p>Matt is a Technical Specialist for Sun Microsystems and supports a variety of<br />
customers across the Western US. Based in Los Angeles, Matt has worked with a<br />
number of customers on Linux and Solaris adoption and migration from other   <br />
platforms. Matt is part of the Web Services practice of the Client Solutions <br />
organization which specializes in use of Java Enterprise System software use <br />
by customers on both platforms.                                                </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Orv Beach has been messing with computers for over 20 years. His first       <br />
experience with computer operating systems was with CP/M, in the early '80s. <br />
His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the  <br />
Linux community.                                                               </p>
<p>He's a principal member of the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, the Marketing  <br />
chair for the Linux Expo of Southern California, and is currently employed as<br />
the Information System Director at Simi Valley Hospital.                       </p>
<p>Orv will demonstrate various command line commands and utilities that are    <br />
useful for administering a Linux system. He'll throw in a few basic bash     <br />
tricks as a bonus.                                                             </p>

Simulation, and Really Remote Scheduling," Scott Maxwell and Frank Hartman,  <br />
NASA JPL.                                                                      </p>
<p>NASA/JPL's Mars Exploration Rover project is the first time a JPL flight     <br />
project has used Linux systems for critical mission operations. Scott Maxwell<br />
and Frank Hartman, two of MER's rover drivers, also wrote the Rover Sequencing 
and Visualization Program (RSVP), the Linux-based software used on Earth to  <br />
drive Spirit and Opportunity. Scott and Frank will discuss the software they <br />
developed, as well as their experiences using Linux to drive two vehicles    <br />
across the Martian terrain, a hundred million miles from Earth.                </p>
