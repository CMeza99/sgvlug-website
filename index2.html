                <div class="entry-content"> <p>You and your family are cordially invited to the SGVLUG &amp; SGVHAK potluck BBQ this Saturday, November 16th, from 1-6pm.  It will be in San Gabriel.</p>
<p>This is a joint effort:
+ Steven Doran is bringing bratwurts and beer.
+ Michael Starch will be in charge of grilling.
+ Lan will be providing the venue and organizing.</p>
<p>Please RSVP using the Google form: <a href="http://bit.ly/17oDrvK">http://bit.ly/17oDrvK</a></p>
<p>You will receive directions to the venue after you submit the RSVP.  You can revise your RSVP at any time.  Some Google scripting magic automatically updates the RSVP with how many people are expected and what people say they are bringing.
Obviously, the earlier you RSVP, the more accurately Lan can plan.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>JPL's Airborne Snow Observatory is an integrated imaging spectrometer and scanning LIDAR for measuring mountain snow albedo, snow depth/snow water equivalent, and ice height (once exposed), led by PI Dr. Tom Painter.  The team recently wrapped our "Snow On" campaign where over a course of 3 months, we flew the Tuolumne River Basin, Sierra Nevada, California above the O'Shaughnessy Dam of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir; focusing initial on the Tuolumne, and then moving to weekly flights over the Uncompahgre Basin, Colorado.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of its customers including Water Resource managers who are keenly interested in Snow melt, the ASO team had to develop and end to end 24 hour latency capability for processing spectrometer and LIDAR data from Level 0 to Level 4 ("ish") products. Fondly referring to these processing campaigns as "rodeos" the team rapidly constructed an open source data processing system at minimal cost and risk that not only met our processing demands, but taught the entire team many lessons about remote sensing of snow and dust properties, algorithm integration, the relationship between computer scientists, and snow hydrologist; flight and engineering teams, geographers, and most importantly lessons about camaraderie that will engender highly innovative and rapid data systems development, and quality science products for years to come.</p>
<p>Chris Mattmann is the Compute Lead for the ASO project and he will humbly tell the story of the Compute processing capability on behalf of the larger team, highlighting contributions of its key members along the way</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p><em><font color="red">Please note that the previously advertised presentation "BIG DATA! 24 hour near real time processing and computation for the JPL Airborne Snow Observatory" is being rescheduled for another time.   Big thanks to Dmitriy and Tom for being willing to put together a presentation for us on short notice.   Cookies have been promised.</font></em></p>
<p>Tom and Dmitriy will present on how they use open source tools at JPL in their line of work.
These tools include: Raspi, GStreamer, Mercurial/Trac, Wireshark, vi, and others.</p>
<p>BIO:
Dmitriy Bekker and Thomas Werne are currently staff engineers in the Instrument Flight and GSE Software group in the Instrument Electronics and Sensors Section at JPL. They are working on FPGA-based data acquisition and processing designs for multiple prototype science instruments for ground, space, and airborne applications as well as technology development for small satellites. Their projects have been deployed to the Mojave Desert, on high altitude aircraft, at observatories, and on CubeSats.</p>
