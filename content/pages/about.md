SGVLUG attracts members from throughout the Los Angeles basin, Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank, and eastward along the San Gabriel Mountains.

Our general meetings used to be at Caltech, but we are no longer able to meet there as of January 2014. Please see the latest annoucement for each month's meeting location.
