Title: "The Internet-in-a-Box Project"

We are building the Internet-in-a-Box - A small, inexpensive device which
provides essential Internet resources without any Internet connection.  It
provides a local copy of half a terabyte of the world's Free information.  

The device includes Wikipedia in a dozen languages, a library of 40,000
e-books, most of the world's open source software and source code, hundreds of
hours of instructional videos, and world-wide mapping down to street level.

We can deploy a "knowledge hotspot" anywhere in the world - even under solar
power.

This Open Source project is being developed by SGVLUG and SGVHAK
members.
