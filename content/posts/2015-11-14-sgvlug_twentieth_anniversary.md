SGVLUG is turning 20 and the entire Southern California Linux community is invited to share in the celebration with fun, food, and prizes! Whether you're a new or a veteran user, there's something for everyone as we reflect on what we've accomplished together and envision where we're going -- all powered by our favorite operating system.

We welcome former members who may have lost touch and want to reconnect with us see and some familiar faces (and some new ones too). We also would love to meet others Linux users from other groups around SoCal and hear what other groups are up to. Food and drinks will be provided, graciously sponsored by our venue host OpenX.

We have some great things planned for a night of fun:

* Community project demos
* LAN gaming
* Linux Jeopardy!
