This month we will have a focused sort of open mic night. We will be featuring
a sort of show and tell for projects. If you have been working on something in
your spare time then we can find time for you to tell us about it. Bring
hardware, pictures or slides, whatever you need to let us know the cool things
you are doing. After getting our dinner orders in we will informally invite
people to share.
