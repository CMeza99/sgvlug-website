Title: "Introduction to Security using Raspberry Pis"
Date: 2013-09-10 15:49

We will demonstrate 4 basic security topics, all using the Rasberry Pi computer.  

Topcs include: 

- "Change Default Passwords, or Else.....if"
- "Clear Text Passwords and HTTP Make Jack a Sad Boy"
- "Cookie Stealing with Joe Blackhat"
- "Stack Smashing in the Real World".  

Come to learn a taste of security, or simply enjoy the show.  

(You can also come for the cookies and/or pie, which was what the presenters demanded as a bribe.)
