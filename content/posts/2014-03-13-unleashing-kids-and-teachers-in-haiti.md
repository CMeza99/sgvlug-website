Curt Thompson and James Murdza, both recently back from trips to Haiti, will
talk about the evolution of the One Laptop per Child Project into Unleash
Kids, their successes and failures working with schools, establishing a
lasting infrastructure, and the technology behind it all.

Some of the projects they will talk about are a mission school using OLPC
laptops and a school server providing internet caching/filtering servers, a
remote off-the-grid school using only solar power to charge ten laptops, an
orphanage with twenty computers and miniature solar panels, and several
schools using Internet-in-a-Box, an offline source of Wikipedia, Khan Academy,
and Open Street Map.
