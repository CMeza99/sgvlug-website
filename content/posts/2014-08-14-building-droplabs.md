Christefano Reyes and Lee Vodra will present: **Building Droplabs: A Business
Model for the Open Source Community**

Founded in 2011, Droplabs is a coworking space, classroom and makerspace in
Downtown Los Angeles. Our community is made up of members who support each
other personally and professionally in a positive environment.

The coworking services and developer programs we offer, like Free Coworking
Days, Coders with a Cause, Mobile Device Lab and Developer Boot Camps, were
made possible because of our love of open source and a passion for learning.

We'd love to see more places like Droplabs, and we're happy to talk at SGVLUG
about how others can replicate our success - and avoid or overcome the
challenges we've had over the years:

* Identifying a space to build a location-based community  
* Traffic and parking in Downtown Los Angeles  
* Making decisions in a consensus-based organization  
* Empowering members to become leaders  
* Disrupting the coworking business model  
* Paying the bills (rent, insurance, staff, etc.)  
* ... and still having fun!
