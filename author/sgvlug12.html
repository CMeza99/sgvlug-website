<p>This workshop will provide a brief overview/intro to EC2 followed by a       <br />

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Michael Proctor-Smith will give an update on MythTV (the Mythical Convergence<br />
Box), the open-source alternative to TiVo or Windows Media Center. More than <br />
just a digital VCR, which provides basic "time shifting" capability, Digital <br />
Video Recorders change the way people watch television by providing the      <br />
ability to pause live TV, instantly replay interesting scenes, and skip      <br />
commercials. With an up-to-date TV schedule, the DVR can automatically record<br />
shows based on user preferences.                                               </p>
<p>Michael will talk about his strange MythTV setup and a small portion of      <br />
MythTV's features including Recording HDTV, streaming to a Cell Phone and    <br />
using an AppleTV as a MythTV Front-end.                                        </p>
<p>Michael Runs The San Gabriel Valley Linux(R) Users Group (At least he has been 
told that by others). He spends an unhealthy amount of his time watching     <br />
MythTV and plotting how he can never be without access to MythTV.              </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>In a presentation called "Geotagging with Linux and Free Software," Tom      <br />
Emerson will describe geotagging, the process of adding geographical         <br />
information to images, which can later be searched. Emerson will show how he <br />
has geotagged photos from his recent vacation and can search for them using  <br />
various search engines, including Google Earth.                                </p>
