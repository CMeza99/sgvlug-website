                <div class="entry-content"> <p>PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people <br />
don't fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover<br />
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    <br />
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    <br />
behind it will not be covered.                                                 </p>
<p>Keysigning party                                                               </p>
<p>One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of       <br />
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the        <br />
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key  <br />
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.                           </p>
<p>About the presenter                                                            </p>
<p>Phil Dibowitz is a UNIX systems administrator for the web systems team at    <br />

redundant, and geographically seperate clusters across the United States. Phil 
has worked as a Linux, Solaris, and Network Administrator, and has a BS in   <br />
Computer Engineering and Computer Science from USC. He is also the author of <br />
iptstate(1), co-founder of the MSS Initiative, and works on IP Filter and the<br />
USB Storage driver in theLlinux kernel. Find out more about Phil Dibowitz at <br />

<p>Due to a scheduling conflict, Chris was unable to present this last November,<br />
so we've asked him to return this month.                                       </p>
<p>Chris Smith of Yahoo! to present a slice of life-on-the-inside of the world's<br />

<p>Chris will demonstrate some of the cutting edge work being conducted at Yahoo! 
Research Labs, all of which is powered by UNIX and open source computing.      </p>
<p>A member of Yahoo!'s Research Technology team, Chris has more than 10 years of 
experience developing enterprise software solutions for both Internet        <br />
start-ups and as a Senior Java Architect for Sun Microsystems.                 </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most<br />
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br />
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br />
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer <br />
act like you were two people doing different things?                           </p>
<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  <br />
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause<br />
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on <br />
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br />
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 </p>
<p>If this describes you and you haven't heard of VMware, then you need to attend 
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we'll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems 
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer -- he plans<br />
to talk about the entier line -- from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br />
their newest offering, the "free" VMware player. (this is "free as in beer", <br />
folks...)                                                                      </p>

<p>Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM. 
By popular vote, the presentation will be targeting the beginner, but there  <br />
will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.                     </p>
<p>Mr. Finley has extensive software development and consulting experience on the 
HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and<br />
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  <br />
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He <br />
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     <br />
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        <br />
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the <br />
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics 
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.                              </p>

<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br />
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br />
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br />
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br />
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  </p>
<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br />
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br />
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br />
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the      <br />
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He's a partner in motion picture technology      <br />
company MovieEditor.com.                                                       </p>
