                <div class="entry-content"> <p>This month we will have a focused sort of open mic night. We will be featuring
a sort of show and tell for projects. If you have been working on something in
your spare time then we can find time for you to tell us about it. Bring
hardware, pictures or slides, whatever you need to let us know the cool things
you are doing. After getting our dinner orders in we will informally invite
people to share.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Curt Thompson and James Murdza, both recently back from trips to Haiti, will
talk about the evolution of the One Laptop per Child Project into Unleash
Kids, their successes and failures working with schools, establishing a
lasting infrastructure, and the technology behind it all.</p>
<p>Some of the projects they will talk about are a mission school using OLPC
laptops and a school server providing internet caching/filtering servers, a
remote off-the-grid school using only solar power to charge ten laptops, an
orphanage with twenty computers and miniature solar panels, and several
schools using Internet-in-a-Box, an offline source of Wikipedia, Khan Academy,
and Open Street Map.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
