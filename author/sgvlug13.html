                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Wilfred Nilsen will present the BarracudaDrive, a secure Web application server 
for the Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) using the<br />
Unslung Linux firmware replacement. Using an external USB Flash memory for    <br />
storing the database files, it should be possible to create an application    <br />
server that is virtually maintenance free.                                      </p>
<p>Wilfred will be here to give a demo of the NSLU2 running BarracudaDrive,      <br />
including the many practical features of BarracudaDrive and how some users use<br />
BarracudaDrive for many non traditional Web server tasks.                       </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the 
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br />
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br />
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br />
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br />
InDaMixx.                                                                      </p>
<p>Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br />
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br />
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br />
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br />
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Chris got his kid an "OLPC" laptop and thinks he can wrestle it away from him<br />
long enough for some "show-n-tell"...                                          </p>
<p>OLPC is the "One Laptop Per Child" initiative, aimed at providing full-fledged 
laptop computers to every child in developing nations. Their goal is for a   <br />
$100/unit price point, and they are quite close (actually, the price is about<br />
$150)                                                                          </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Dan Kegel of Google, a longtime Linux user and developer, will present a     <br />
grab-bag of interesting topics:                                              <br />
<em> Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google's photo management    <br />
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don't know about the Linux 
  version)                                                                 <br />
</em> Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux's implementation of Win32; it   <br />
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 <br />
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux's answer to ZFS, kind of; it<br />
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   <br />
  those snapshots to remote systems.)                                        </p>
<p>Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager<br />
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  <br />
questions you like.                                                            </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Asterisk is an open-source PBX program that provides automatic call          <br />
distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      <br />
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br />
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br />
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br />
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                </p>
<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.                                                        </p>
