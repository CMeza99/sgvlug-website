                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX     <br />
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br />
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br />
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br />
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br />
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    </p>
<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br />
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br />
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br />
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br />
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br />
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br />
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br />
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br />
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br />
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br />
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br />
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br />
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.  </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    <br />
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         <br />
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  </p>
<p>Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions  <br />
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       <br />
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his<br />
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      <br />
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and <br />
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior  <br />
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at 
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both 
http://www.voipspeak.net and http://www.asterisktutorials.com. Kerry is an   <br />
avid amateur photographer who writes tutorials and product reviews for his   <br />
photography blog site at http://L7Foto.com.                                    </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>X509 and SSL are complicated topics. While they share the basic PKI          <br />
infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more  <br />
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and <br />
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and       <br />
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL   <br />
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss<br />
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a          <br />
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP<br />
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.               </p>
<p>Phil Dibowitz is a Senior UNIX Systems Administrator for the Web Systems team<br />
