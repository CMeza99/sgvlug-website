<p>The idea is to have a fun meeting with some scary stories and trouble shooting 
lessons to be learned. Depending on how quickly the presentation goes we may <br />
have time to share more, so please feel free to bring your horror story and  <br />
what you did to resolve it.                                                    </p>

<p>Christefano who was going to present Redmine is unavailable so we will try to<br />
reschedule.                                                                    </p>
<p>Virtual Private Servers: On a Budget - We will discuss a class of virtual    <br />
private servers available at a low price point allowing individuals to get   <br />
many of the benefits of dedicated hardware without the cost thanks to        <br />
virtualization technologies and a competitive marketplace.                     </p>

<p>Command Line "Tips and Tricks"                                                 </p>
<p>Lan Dang spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and             <br />
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She<br />
has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her 
arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command  <br />
execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities. This talk<br />
will cover useful one-liners and the small set of useful commands that will  <br />
get you started using these tools or using them in new ways. Whether you're a<br />
newbie or a command line guru, you'll probably pick up something useful for  <br />
the next time you're at the command line.                                      </p>

<h2>Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:</h2>
<p>Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   <br />
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   <br />
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  </p>
<p>Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   <br />
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    <br />
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing<br />
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     </p>
<p>Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   <br />
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary <br />
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           <br />
$10-20/month VPS account.                                                      </p>
<p>Bio: ----- Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where   <br />
Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website deployment. He is a   <br />
sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) <br />
and has been on the Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org webmaster teams since   <br />
2008. Exaltation of Larks, which provides Drupal consulting, development and <br />
