                <div class="entry-content"> <p>MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL <br />
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      <br />
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              <br />
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is<br />
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        <br />
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  <br />
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                      <br />
<em> Requirements of MySQL Replication                                        <br />
</em> Concepts of MySQL Replication                                            <br />
<em> Configuring MySQL Replication                                            <br />
</em> Troubleshooting MySQL Replication                                          </p>
<p>Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged <br />
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    <br />
<em> Pyramid Architectures                                                    <br />
</em> Dual Masters                                                             <br />
<em> Circular Replication                                                     <br />
</em> Circular Replication of Masters                                            </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>A couple of "Core OS" developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and 
they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    <br />
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    <br />
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     <br />
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       <br />
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                            <br />
<em> hardware detection and configuration,                                    <br />
</em> creation of installation CDs,                                            <br />
<em> package dependancy checker,                                              <br />
</em> translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      <br />
* many internal CGI/Web applications.                                        </p>
<p>"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development<br />
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          <br />
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits<br />
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   <br />
Linux distribution as an example."                                             </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>The topic for the evening will be "Getting a job in 2006: Is it the dot-com  <br />
bubble all over again?" This event will include a presentation on the current<br />
state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  <br />
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself 
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this<br />
session will provide valuable information on how to land a great job. A major<br />
theme will be how to think like a corporate recruiter.                         </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
For over 5 years, Todd Cranston-Cuebas has led technology hiring at          <br />
Ticketmaster. He specializes in working with candidates who have backgrounds <br />
in open-source tools and technologies. He has spoken at BOF sessions at a    <br />
number of large technology conferences, including ApacheCon, OSCON, USENIX,  <br />
and, of course, at SGVLUG meetings. He also is the scheduler and host for this 
year's monthly perl-centric "Tech Talks" for the LA.pm.                        </p>
