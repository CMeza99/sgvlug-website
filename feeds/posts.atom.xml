The team recently wrapped our "Snow On" campaign where over a course of 3 months, we flew the Tuolumne River Basin, Sierra Nevada, California above the O'Shaughnessy Dam of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir; focusing initial on the Tuolumne, and then moving to weekly flights over the Uncompahgre Basin, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet the needs of its customers including Water Resource managers who are keenly interested in Snow melt, the ASO team had to develop and end to end 24 hour latency capability for processing spectrometer and LIDAR data from Level 0 to Level 4 ("ish") products. Fondly referring to these processing campaigns as "rodeos" the team rapidly constructed an open source data processing system at minimal cost and risk that not only met our processing demands, but taught the entire team many lessons about remote sensing of snow and dust properties, algorithm integration, the relationship between computer scientists, and snow hydrologist; flight and engineering teams, geographers, and most importantly lessons about camaraderie that will engender highly innovative and rapid data systems development, and quality science products for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Mattmann is the Compute Lead for the ASO project and he will humbly tell the story of the Compute processing capability on behalf of the larger team, highlighting contributions of its key members along the way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern day Linux Infrastructure should be flexible, scalable and able to deal
with the constant changes any business will require.  Automation is key to a
reliable and consistence server infrastructure, Automation also allows for easy
integration of new changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DevOps movement melds two traditionally siloed teams; Application
Developers and Operations Engineers.  Writing infrastructure as code presents a
number of challenges and potential pitfalls, Operations Engineers need to write
code (something they may not be familar with) and Developers need to have a
strong understanding of the system (many Developers don't want to be considered
with anything other than web applications).  There are several major projects
related purely to the management of infrastructure as code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will examine Opscode Chef and make a strong use case for the implementation
of Opscode Chef in a Linux Environment.  David will demonstrate many techniques
to utilize Chef quickly and efficiently to minimize the time of implementation.
Although Opscode Chef can be run on Solaris, FreeBSD and even Windows, the
presentation will discuss Linux and only Linux.  David will also discuss the
techniques to operate Chef on various Linux Distros which can provide a layer
of abstraction from the package management systems (apt &amp;amp; yum).  Finally David
will discuss how Chef can be used to rebuild an Entire infrastructure
(regardless of size or complexity) in a time previous thought impossible.  The
only limitation in speed of deployment is the hardware.  &lt;/p&gt;

The presentation will use examples throughout to provide genuine use-cases for the tool.  The Presentation is focused on Practical Application Troubleshooting, it will not be an in-depth guide to the various System Calls.  I will demonstrate many techniques that can help you to gain a deeper understanding of application execution flow on a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like working on hardware projects?  Did you just get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Kinect with the intentions of doing something cool?  Did you wish that there was a local meetup group where you can meet up with like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to our kickoff meeting on Thursday to discuss starting up this special interest group.  Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and share some of the projects you've been working on. And if we can decide on a name for the SIG, we can set up things like a mailing list, website, and wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

lot of infrastructure to set up and it was all due yesterday. If only
you could clone all the sysadmins of the world to get all of their
expertise and know-how in deploying open source applications, you could
actually get it done. Perhaps there is a way: Juju and Charms! Juju
encapsulates services in a way that promotes sharing and collaboration
the same way packages have done for open source software.  If you are
a sysadmin or a developer who is looking to get an infrastructure of
databases, loadbalancers, and webapps up to speed rapidly, Juju may
be interesting. If you are looking into deploying something massively
scalable, like OpenStack or Hadoop, Juju is built to handle that task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        &lt;br /&gt;
controversy in the Linux world.                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting &lt;br /&gt;
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in 
which it's been included.                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   &lt;br /&gt;
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           &lt;br /&gt;
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   &lt;br /&gt;
for.                                                                           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   &lt;br /&gt;
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   &lt;br /&gt;
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   &lt;br /&gt;
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    &lt;br /&gt;
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing&lt;br /&gt;
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   &lt;br /&gt;
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary &lt;br /&gt;
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           &lt;br /&gt;
$10-20/month VPS account.                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio: ----- Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where   &lt;br /&gt;
Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website deployment. He is a   &lt;br /&gt;
sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) &lt;br /&gt;
and has been on the Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org webmaster teams since   &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as position &lt;br /&gt;
reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other radio operators and  &lt;br /&gt;
eventually propagated to the Internet.                                       &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices opens up 
many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing solutions. Amateur   &lt;br /&gt;
radio operator and long time Linux user James McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using&lt;br /&gt;
the Seagate GoFlex Net along with surplus amateur radio equipment to build a &lt;br /&gt;
APRS digipeater for helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-line content is reading material, educational texts, and other reference &lt;br /&gt;
materials delivered on media such as SDCards, DVDs, custom hardware, or hard &lt;br /&gt;
drives so that it can be used without internet access. A typical deployment  &lt;br /&gt;
can deliver the equivalent of tens of thousands of printed books. The cost to&lt;br /&gt;
deliver large off-line libraries has fallen below the cost to deliver online &lt;br /&gt;
internet access in most areas. Off-line content thus provides a cost effective 
way to provide access to the world's knowledge before affordable internet    &lt;br /&gt;
infrastructure is available. This presentation reviews six emerging projects &lt;br /&gt;
which aim to provide off-line hardware and libraries, including the author's &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is back!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and software&lt;br /&gt;
project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book reader for developing   &lt;br /&gt;
nations.                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of Wikipedia and&lt;br /&gt;
display it on any TV set in a developing-world village library - all for under 
$20. It is also a fun general purpose 8-bit computing platform comparable in &lt;br /&gt;
raw capability to the Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and   &lt;br /&gt;
hobbyists. The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross   &lt;br /&gt;
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.                             &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab, assembly, &lt;br /&gt;
and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience through each stage, cover  &lt;br /&gt;
which tools were used, ponder major design considerations, and pay special   &lt;br /&gt;
attention to open source solutions.                                            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Wyble is a systems and security engineer. His focus in 2010 is       &lt;br /&gt;
security research, with a particular emphasis on improving performance of    &lt;br /&gt;
automated analytic systems. In support of this, he does a lot of networking  &lt;br /&gt;
stuff and is in the process of building a malware lab.                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lives in sunny southern California, with his wife Patricia and 2 dogs ISIS&lt;br /&gt;
and OSPF. Yes they are named after routing protocols. He frequently hosts    &lt;br /&gt;
hacker parties, where all sorts of cool stuff gets built. You will often find&lt;br /&gt;
him at various hot startups doing consulting, and at numerous user group     &lt;br /&gt;
meetings throughout the southwestern United States.                            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Wyble will be joining the SGVLUG group once again and discussing the &lt;br /&gt;
topic of data ownership / private cloud.                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning ones data is a critical and often overlooked part of security. As such, 
he will discuss how he maintains numerous web properties on a Linux server at&lt;br /&gt;
his residence, connected to the best DSL ATT has to offer.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has recently completed moving all his data onto his own server, freeing it&lt;br /&gt;
(mostly) from the control of google,yahoo etc. It was a relatively           &lt;br /&gt;
straightforward process, encompassing 4 major phases. He will talk about the &lt;br /&gt;
tools he utilizes, and advantages/disadvantages to his setup and some of the &lt;br /&gt;
problems he encountered.                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company developing&lt;br /&gt;
new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets, like, for example, the  &lt;br /&gt;
entire routing structure of the internet, or tens of thousands of documents.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of Open   &lt;br /&gt;
Source software which made the project possible. Dependencies included Boost,&lt;br /&gt;
CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko, Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd,    &lt;br /&gt;
Xerces DOM, and more. Theses building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and 
beyond) their limits, deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows         &lt;br /&gt;
environment, and compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,&lt;br /&gt;
better alternatives, and other findings.                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braddock Gaskill is CEO and co-founder of Dockside Vision Inc, an advanced   &lt;br /&gt;
information visualization and human-computer interface company. Prior to     &lt;br /&gt;
founding Dockside Vision, Mr. Gaskill had over ten years of experience as a  &lt;br /&gt;
technology consultant in both the defense and commercial sectors. His        &lt;br /&gt;

InDaMixx.                                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp;amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp;amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    &lt;br /&gt;
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his&lt;br /&gt;
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     &lt;br /&gt;
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    &lt;br /&gt;
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 &lt;/p&gt;

will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    &lt;br /&gt;
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     &lt;br /&gt;

incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        &lt;br /&gt;
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with &lt;br /&gt;
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   &lt;br /&gt;
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic &lt;br /&gt;
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      &lt;br /&gt;

Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     &lt;br /&gt;
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  &lt;br /&gt;
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   &lt;br /&gt;
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to &lt;br /&gt;
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  &lt;br /&gt;

more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software      &lt;br /&gt;

only Microsoft MVP with "unix" in his domain name (unixwiz.net).               &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your    &lt;br /&gt;
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got   &lt;br /&gt;
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude        &lt;br /&gt;
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a 
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to    &lt;br /&gt;
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements &lt;br /&gt;
to the Internet.                                                               &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and&lt;br /&gt;
has been playing with Linux since the late 90's. His friends and family think&lt;br /&gt;
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   &lt;br /&gt;
with, especially if it works with Linux.                                       &lt;/p&gt;

MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL &lt;br /&gt;
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      &lt;br /&gt;
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              &lt;br /&gt;
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is&lt;br /&gt;
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        &lt;br /&gt;
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  &lt;br /&gt;
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                      &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged &lt;br /&gt;
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    &lt;br /&gt;

they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    &lt;br /&gt;
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    &lt;br /&gt;
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     &lt;br /&gt;
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       &lt;br /&gt;
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                            &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development&lt;br /&gt;
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          &lt;br /&gt;
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of       &lt;br /&gt;
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the        &lt;br /&gt;
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key  &lt;br /&gt;
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.                           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most&lt;br /&gt;
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite &lt;br /&gt;
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system&lt;br /&gt;
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer &lt;br /&gt;
act like you were two people doing different things?                           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  &lt;br /&gt;
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause&lt;br /&gt;
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on &lt;br /&gt;
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  &lt;br /&gt;
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 &lt;/p&gt;

systems engineering, says: "For the past couple of months, I've been working &lt;br /&gt;
with Plone. It's an impressive system, and not exactly something you pick up &lt;br /&gt;
in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related development; Plone 
is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals like bowling            &lt;br /&gt;
pins...provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite powerful."         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Zope and Plone:                                                          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Zope is an open source application server for building content management   &lt;br /&gt;
systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications....Zope is written in   &lt;br /&gt;
Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting language."              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is built on &lt;br /&gt;
the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires minimal effort to &lt;br /&gt;
set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web  &lt;br /&gt;
content that is ideal for project groups, communities and intranets."          &lt;/p&gt;
