                <div class="entry-content"> <p>We are building the Internet-in-a-Box - A small, inexpensive device which
provides essential Internet resources without any Internet connection.  It
provides a local copy of half a terabyte of the world's Free information.  </p>
<p>The device includes Wikipedia in a dozen languages, a library of 40,000
e-books, most of the world's open source software and source code, hundreds of
hours of instructional videos, and world-wide mapping down to street level.</p>
<p>We can deploy a "knowledge hotspot" anywhere in the world - even under solar
